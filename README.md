# NFHS-5 District-Level Data Visualization & Exploratory Analysis

This repository contains a collection of **data visualization and exploratory data analysis projects**, with a primary focus on a **district-level analysis of India’s National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5)** dataset.  
In addition to the NFHS-5 case study, the repository includes **smaller analytical and visualization exercises** implemented using Python visualization libraries.

## 📊 Datasets

### NFHS-5 (Primary Dataset)
- **Source:** National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), Government of India  
- **Granularity:** District-level  
- **Coverage:** Health, nutrition, literacy, maternal and child health, and social indicators  

### Additional Datasets
- Small and publicly available datasets used for **practice, comparison, and visualization experimentation** (e.g., sample datasets commonly used for statistical visualization).

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze **regional and district-level disparities** in health and social outcomes  
- Visualize relationships between **female literacy, maternal health, and child health indicators**  
- Apply **geospatial visualization techniques** to highlight inequality patterns  
- Practice and compare multiple **data visualization libraries**  
- Present insights in a **clear, interpretable, and visual-first manner**
