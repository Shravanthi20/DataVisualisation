Understand the components

AVG([Delivery Cost])

This gives the average delivery cost for a given state (or row in the visualization).

Think of it as the “raw value” you want to scale.

WINDOW_MAX(AVG([Insurance %]))

WINDOW_MAX is a table calculation in Tableau.

It finds the maximum insurance % across the current window (e.g., the Top 5 states currently shown).

WINDOW_MAX(AVG([Delivery Cost]))

Similarly, this finds the maximum delivery cost across the same window.
